Interactive geometry CAD-like educational software.

Preview in browser (requires Silverlight): http://livegeometry.com

Live Geometry lets you create interactive ruler and compass constructions and experiment with them. It is CAD-like educational software for teachers and students. It helps visualize and solve geometry problems.

The project is written with Silverlight 4 and C# 4.0 (Visual Studio 2010).

The core engine is a flexible and extensible framework that allows you to easily add new figure types and features. The project has two front-ends: WPF and Silverlight; they both share the common DynamicGeometry library.
