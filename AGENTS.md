# Notes for agents working in this repo

Persistent working notes. Keep them factual and short; update or delete entries that stop
being true. Things derivable from the code or git history don't belong here.

## Layout

- `Main/Avalonia/` - the live codebase. Solution `LiveGeometry.Avalonia.slnx`:
  - `DynamicGeometry/` - the geometry library (assembly `DynamicGeometry.Avalonia`), a fork of
    the WPF sources rewritten onto Avalonia, plus `WpfCompat/` shims.
  - `LiveGeometry/` - shared UI (`MainView`), used by both heads.
  - `LiveGeometry.Desktop/` - desktop head (net10.0).
  - `LiveGeometry.Browser/` - WASM head (net10.0-browser), deployed to https://livegeometry.com.
- `Main/DynamicGeometryLibrary`, `Main/WPFClient`, `Main/Silverlight*` - the older WPF/Silverlight
  generation. Reference only.
- `Reference/VB6/Source/` - source of the original VB6 app ("DG"). A built copy lives outside the
  repo at `C:\Dropbox\Projects\DG 1\Source\Geometry.exe` (process name `Geometry`).
- `tools/` - file-based C# tools (`dotnet run tools/x.cs -- args`), see below.

## Working rules

- Kirill reviews and commits everything himself: never commit, push, or otherwise change git
  state. Leave changes in the working tree, no need to report them.
- Scripting is C# file-based apps (`dotnet run file.cs`). No Python on this machine.

## Build and run

- Desktop: `dotnet build Main/Avalonia/LiveGeometry.Desktop/LiveGeometry.Desktop.csproj`, then
  run `bin/Debug/net10.0/LiveGeometry.Desktop.exe`. Fastest loop; use it for feature work.
- Browser: needs the `wasm-tools` workload (`WasmBuildNative=true` links Skia/HarfBuzz; without
  it Skia throws DllNotFoundException). Do a full bin/obj clean when native assets change.
- Browser publish: `dotnet publish Main/Avalonia/LiveGeometry.Browser/LiveGeometry.Browser.csproj -c Release -o <dir>`.
  Output is `<dir>/web.config` + `<dir>/wwwroot/`. CI (`.github/workflows/main_livegeometry.yml`)
  does exactly this and deploys to Azure App Service (IIS).

## Gotchas

- **Trimming only happens on Release publish**, never in `dotnet run`. The geometry library is
  discovered via reflection (`GetTypes()` for behaviors, serializers, figures), hence
  `TrimmerRootAssembly DynamicGeometry.Avalonia` in the Browser csproj. A trimming break shows
  up as a white screen and a `CRASH: ...` console line (`Program.cs` prints those). Anything new
  that is reached only by reflection outside that assembly needs its own root.
- **StyleKeyOverride**: a subclass of a templated Avalonia control (TabControl, TabItem, ListBox,
  Button, UserControl, ColorPicker...) renders invisible unless it overrides `StyleKeyOverride`
  to return the base type.
- **Input**: all WPF-style mouse events funnel through `DynamicGeometry/Behaviors/Behavior.cs`
  (pointer adapters live there). Avalonia has no static Keyboard; modifiers come from event args.
- **Browser has no system fonts.** Text renders only because `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter` is embedded
  (`.WithInterFont()`); font names stored in drawings (Arial etc.) fall back to it.
- **web.config**: `LiveGeometry.Browser/web.config` is hand-written (serves the precompressed
  `.br` files, sets immutable caching on fingerprinted assets, `no-cache` on entry files). The
  wasm SDK drops a project web.config from publish, so the csproj copies it with an explicit
  `AfterTargets="Publish"` target. It sits at the publish root and rewrites into `wwwroot\`.
  There is no IIS locally: verify changes after deploy with
  `curl -s -o /dev/null -D - -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, br" https://livegeometry.com/_framework/<file>`
  and expect `Content-Encoding: br` and `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
  A malformed web.config takes the whole site down (HTTP 500).

## UI automation (tools/)

Screenshots are PNGs; image pixels are the click coordinates in both tools.

- `tools/winauto.cs` - any desktop window (the VB6 app, the Avalonia desktop app).
  `list`, `tree <t>`, `menu <t>`, `invoke <t> <menuId>`, `shot <t> out.png`, `click <t> x y [right|double]`,
  `drag <t> x1 y1 x2 y2`, `keys <t> "^s"`, `text`, `focus`, `place <t> x y w h`.
  Target = process name | `pid:N` | `hwnd:0x..` | `title:substr`.
  - Both apps start maximized on a 4K/200% monitor: `place <t> 100 100 1500 1000` first.
  - VB6 has a native menu: `menu Geometry` lists every command with its id and `invoke` runs one
    without touching the mouse (49 = Segment, 56 = Circle, 46 = Point...). Its status bar shows
    the current tool's prompt. VB6 is DPI-unaware; `shot` compensates.
  - Avalonia has no native menus or child windows: screenshot, then click by coordinates.
- `tools/webauto.cs` - the browser build in headless Edge over CDP (port 9333, Edge stays alive
  between calls). `start <url> [w h]`, `stop`, `nav`, `wait <console text>`, `console [--errors]`,
  `shot`, `click`, `drag`, `move`, `key <Key> [ctrl] [shift] [alt]`, `text`, `eval <js>`.
  - The app takes several seconds to boot after `start`; the splash `div` stays in the DOM, so
    don't test for its absence - take a screenshot.
  - Edge runs with `--guest`; without it Edge signs the throwaway profile into the Windows
    account and opens a sync dialog as an extra page target.
- `tools/serve.cs <publish>/wwwroot [port]` - static server for a publish output (blocks; run in
  the background). Separate file because a running server locks its own exe.

Web smoke test (run before deploying changes that touch file I/O, clipboard, fonts, or anything
reflection-based): publish Release, `serve` its wwwroot, `webauto start http://localhost:5005/`,
`console --errors` must show no `CRASH:`, draw a segment via the Lines tab, `shot`, `stop`.

.lgf open/save through the browser storage provider, PNG export, printing, demo download, and
the `Hyperlink` figure's use of `WebClient`.
